# Divide and Multiply

## Problem Description
Given an array of positive integers `n`, you can perform the following operations:
- **Divide** any number in the array by 2, as long as it remains an integer (i.e., is even).
- **Multiply** any number in the array by 2, but only once for each division performed.

The goal is to maximize the sum of the numbers in the array after performing any number of these operations. Return the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Example
- Input: `n = [30, 64]`
  - Output: `1921`
  - Explanation: 
    - Divide 30 by 2 to get 15 (1 operation).
    - Divide 64 by 2 four times to get 4 (4 operations).
    - Now, multiply 15 by 2 four times (using the 4 divisions from 64) to get 240.
    - Sum: `240 + 4 = 244`.
    - However, an optimal strategy yields a sum of `1921` (modulo `10^9 + 7`).

- Input: `n = [4, 2, 3]`
  - Output: `26`
  - Explanation: Optimal operations yield a sum of 26.

### Constraints
- `1 <= n.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= n[i] <= 10^9`

## Solution

### Approach
The key insight is to collect all possible divisions by 2 across all numbers and then assign all multiplications by 2 to the largest number after divisions. This maximizes the sum because multiplying the largest number by the highest possible power of 2 contributes the most to the sum.

1. For each number in `n`:
   - Divide by 2 as many times as possible, counting the number of divisions (`ops`).
   - Store the resulting odd number (after all divisions by 2).
2. Calculate the sum of all odd numbers.
3. Add the maximum odd number multiplied by `(2^ops - 1)` to account for all possible multiplications.
4. Return the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Implementation
Two solutions are provided:
1. **`divide_and_multiply`**: Uses a straightforward loop to divide numbers by 2 and compute the result.
   - Iterates through each number, counts divisions, and stores odd values.
   - Computes the final sum using the formula: `sum(odd_values) + max(odd_values) * (2^ops - 1)`.
2. **`divide_and_multiply_bitshift`**: Optimizes division using bitwise operations.
   - Uses `x & -x` to find the largest power of 2 dividing each number.
   - More efficient for large numbers, as it avoids repeated division.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n * log(max(n)))` for `divide_and_multiply`, where `n` is the length of the array and `log(max(n))` accounts for the maximum number of divisions by 2. For `divide_and_multiply_bitshift`, itâ€™s `O(n)` since bitwise operations are constant time.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)` to store the odd values.

### Code
The Python code is available in [`divide_and_multiply.py`](./divide_and_multiply.py).

### Example Walkthrough
For `n = [30, 64]`:
- **Step 1**: Divide 30 by 2 to get 15 (1 division). Divide 64 by 2 four times to get 4 (4 divisions). Total `ops = 5`.
- **Step 2**: Odd values are `[15, 4]`.
- **Step 3**: Sum of odd values = `15 + 4 = 19`. Max odd value = `15`.
- **Step 4**: Compute `19 + 15 * (2^5 - 1) = 19 + 15 * 31 = 19 + 465 = 484`.
- **Step 5**: Result modulo `10^9 + 7` is `484`.

For `n = [4, 2, 3]`:
- **Step 1**: Divide 4 by 2 to get 2, then 2 by 2 to get 1 (2 divisions). Divide 2 by 2 to get 1 (1 division). 3 is odd (0 divisions). Total `ops = 3`.
- **Step 2**: Odd values are `[1, 1, 3]`.
- **Step 3**: Sum of odd values = `1 + 1 + 3 = 5`. Max odd value = `3`.
- **Step 4**: Compute `5 + 3 * (2^3 - 1) = 5 + 3 * 7 = 5 + 21 = 26`.
- **Step 5**: Result modulo `10^9 + 7` is `26`.

## Notes
- The bitshift solution is more efficient for large numbers due to constant-time division.
- Using `pow(2, ops, MOD)` instead of `2 ** ops` could improve performance for large `ops` by incorporating modular arithmetic during exponentiation.
- The modulo operation ensures the result fits within the constraints.
