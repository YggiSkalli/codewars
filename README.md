# Codewars Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to Codewars katas, organized by problem. Each problem has its own folder with a solution file and a README describing the approach. Tests are located in the `tests` directory.

## Structure
- `problems/`: Contains subdirectories for each problem, with solution files and READMEs.
- `tests/`: Contains unit tests for each solution.

## Running Tests
To run tests for a specific problem, use:
```bash
python -m unittest tests.test_<problem_name>
```
